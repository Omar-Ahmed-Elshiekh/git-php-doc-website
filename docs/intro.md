# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to **Build And Learn Git With PHP** tutorial.

Git is one of the most powerful tools for developers, but have you ever stopped to wonder 
how it really works? in this tutorial we'll dive deep into Git and learn how it works under the hood by 
implementing some of Git commands our selfs using PHP.

In this tutorial, we'll implement:

- init
- hash-object
- cat-file
- write-tree
- ls-tree
- add
- ls-files
- commit
- log

By building these commands, you’ll gain an in-depth understanding of how Git operates at its core.

:::note
While we’ll explain each command and its functionality as we go, having a basic familiarity with Git’s main commands and concepts will make this journey smoother and more rewarding.
:::

I encourage you to try building the commands yourself first. Although the first two or three commands might be challenging, as you move forward in this project, you will find the rest of the commands are just repetitive work.

Let’s get started and bring Git to life with PHP!
