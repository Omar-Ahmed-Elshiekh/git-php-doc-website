# Final thoughts

And we are done! This project was a fun dive into how version control works under the hood. Hopefully, it gave you a better understanding of how commits, logs, and object storage come together to track changes.

Of course, there’s always room for improvement! If you’ve got ideas to make it better, go ahead and experiment. Whether you're here to learn, tinker, or contribute, I hope you found this project useful.

Thanks for checking it out — happy coding!
